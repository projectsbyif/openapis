Telecommunication providers generate a huge amount of data from running their services. Through operating cell towers, mobile phone companies know the approximate location of all their subscribers at all times. Laws such as the Investigatory Powers Act require ISPs to retain Internet Connection Records for their users&rsquo; network usage.

What if the data locked inside telcos could be used for public good?

## Saxford City Council is requesting bulk location data

Saxford City Council is planning to pedestrianize key streets in the city centre to tackle poor air quality.

Although we have rich, street-level data about air quality in Saxford, we lack footfall and cyclist data. Better data would help to prioritise the streets in which the highest number of people are affected by poor air quality.

The Council is confident that cellular location and WiFi hotspot data would help provide the information we need.

We have applied to the [Data Protection Office](#) for permission to request bulk data from two telecommunications companies:

* Morlyn Mobile
* Cabler Telecom

You are invited to read and comment on the full request, [which is available on saxford.gov.uk](https://gist.github.com/paulfurley/21ac195a66803588a27870f634dfef02#file-collection_request-md) and as [machine-readable data.](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/paulfurley/21ac195a66803588a27870f634dfef02/raw/75910d4dd41091f1fd7e49636169c0e09957b76c/collection_request.json)

## Public information notices

The Council will take every practical measure to ensure citizens are informed about the purpose of the project and the measures in place to ensure individual privacy is protected.

### SMS notifications

The council will use the Local Alert Broadcasting system to issue SMS alerts to people entering the affected area during the 30 days preceding the trial.

### WiFi Hotpot alerts

During the trial itself, the privately operated WiFi hotspot screens will be switched from advertising mode to a notification screen. This will display the number of users and allow users to opt out.
