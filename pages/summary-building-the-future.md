Much of the data and technology already exists to build the world shown in the case studies.

Rapid innovation and new empowering services are appearing in the finance sector. It's possible to repeat this success elsewhere.

Meanwhile, new rights will require that companies open up access to much of the data we've explored.

## Companies may take the path of least resistance

Excellent new services won&rsquo;t happen automatically. People won't be able to exercise their new rights if services are poorly implemented.

The well-meaning EU &lsquo;cookie law&rsquo; showed that without positive, practical guidance, companies may **comply** with, rather than **embrace** new rights.

How do we encourage new services that empower people while respecting their rights?

## Standardized, Open APIs will enable better services

The [Open Banking APIs](#) are demonstrating that stronger and more open data infrastructure, standardisation and requiring companies to open up to third parties help create an environment where new empowering services can emerge.

APIs for accessing usage data would shift more control over data back to the people and communities, unlocking it from the company.

APIs for joining and leaving companies would make it easier to switch, giving people real power to 'choose with their feet'.

APIs for machine-readable terms and conditions could demystify the jargon and shift the power back to the people.

APIs for bulk data, with built-in safety mechanisms, would enable public institutions to improve our towns and cities in a cost effective way.
