Much of the data and technology already exists to build the world shown in the case studies.

Rapid innovation and new empowering services are appearing in the finance sector. It's possible to repeat this success elsewhere.


Meanwhile, [new digital rights](#) will require that companies open up access to much of the data we've explored.

## Companies may take the path of least resistance

Excellent new services won't happen automatically. People won't be able to exercise their new rights if services are poorly implemented.

The well-meaning EU 'cookie law' showed that without positive, practical guidance, companies may **comply** with, rather than **embrace** new digital rights.

How do we encourage new services that empower people while respecting their rights?

## Standardized, Open APIs will enable better services

The [Open Banking APIs](#) are demonstrating that standardisation and requiring companies to open up to third parties can create new empowering services.

APIs for accessing usage data would shift the value of data back to the person, unlocking it from the company.

APIs for joining and leaving companies would make it easier to switch, giving people real power to 'choose with their feet'.

APIs for machine-readable terms and conditions could demystify the jargon and shift the power back to the person.

APIs for bulk data, with built-in safety mechanisms, would enable public institutions to improve our towns and cities in a cost effective way.
