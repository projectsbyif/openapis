## Enabling new products and services

Open APIs will enable easier switching, but we believe this will not just be about making it easier to get a better deal. It should make it possible for people to switch along axes other than price, for example in understanding privacy trade-offs or signal streangth as was shown in the [AutoSwap prototype](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator).

There is also the potentual to provide better services to currenlty underserved groups.

In this work we have explored such services for shared households, but other areas we beleieve could benefit from taylored services built on top of Open APIs include carers managing the bills on behlf of others, companies operating in multiple locations looking to get the best mobile coverage from multiple providers, and operators of connected devices with non-standard usage patterns.

Finally, there is the oppertunity for giving people ways of proving facts about themsleves without revealing large amounts of information. This is again particuarly interessting in the context of shared households, where the person with their name on the bill is the only person able to use the value of that.

If standards developed in the UK could also be adopted internationally, there exists the opeprtunity to create international services - for example allowing companies opperating in multiple duristictions the ability to manage their billing tarrifs for their mobile devices. This may become increasingly important in the context of Brexit.

Further, if complementary open APIs can be developed and adopted by other actors in other sectors - for example, water, energy and housing - then whole new classes of products become possible along the lines of the [BillsBox](http://localhost:3000/scenario-2-managing-utility-bills-in-a-shared-household) prototype presented in this report.

##Permissions and design

* Sensitive data, so good design patterns for data sharing are important

* This is doubly important because of GDPR

* How do we encourage new services that empower people while respecting their rights?

##Supporting data infrastructure

To enable these types of products and services, it will not be enough to provide APIs onto the core [closed data](https://theodi.org/data-spectrum) like billing or usage. There are a number of supporting datasets that will need to be made open under appropriate licences.

These broadly fall into two categories.

The first is data about the infrastructure. These include things like locations of cell towers, networks speeds, lists of operators, hotspot locations and capabilities, and payment plans.

It's not just about the core closed data, also supporting datasets like locations of cell towers, tariffs and signal strength.

There second category is data about rights. To enable people and organsiations to make decisions based on privacy and their digital rights. 

We have [written elsewhere](https://projectsbyif.com/blog/ethics-markets-and-registers) about the need for structured, auditable data about how organisations implement access to digital rights to enable individuals and markets to make better decisions.

So, any consideration of supporting open datasets should also examine how data about terms and conditions, and privacy policies are published.

<!-- APIs for accessing usage data would shift more control over data back to the people and communities, unlocking it from the company.

APIs for joining and leaving companies would make it easier to switch, giving people real power to 'vote with their feet'.

APIs for machine-readable terms and conditions could demystify the jargon and shift the -->

##Public trust and oversight

* New services enabled by Open APIs may also educate the public about what data is held about them and the potetntual uses.

* To get public trust, we need new laws, practices, standards and oversight for collection and reuse of data

APIs for bulk data, with built-in safety mechanisms, would enable public institutions to improve our towns and cities in a cost effective way.

* It is important to understand the constrainst of existing telcos, but also direction of travel.

* Build on what already exists


How to get there

* Companies may take the path of least resistance

Ineventable becomes faster / more fine grained


Excellent new services won&rsquo;t happen automatically. People won't be able to exercise their new rights if services are poorly implemented.

The well-meaning EU &lsquo;cookie law&rsquo; showed that without positive, practical guidance, companies may **comply** with, rather than **embrace** new rights.

Much of the data and technology already exists to build the world shown in the case studies.

Rapid innovation and new empowering services are appearing in the finance sector. It's possible to repeat this success elsewhere.

Meanwhile, new rights will require that companies open up access to much of the data we've explored.
