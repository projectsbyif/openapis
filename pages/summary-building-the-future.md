## Enabling new products and services

Open APIs will enable easier switching, but we believe this will not just be about making it easier to get a better deal. It should make it possible for people to switch along axes other than price, for example in understanding privacy trade-offs or signal strength as was shown in the [AutoSwap prototype](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator).

There is also the potential to provide better services to currently under-served groups. In this report we have explored such services for shared households, but other areas we believe could benefit from tailored services built on top of Open APIs include: carers managing the bills on behalf of others; companies operating in multiple locations looking to get the best mobile coverage from multiple providers; operators of networks of connected devices with non-standard usage patterns; and people campaigning for better broadband and mobile connectivity.

In general, more real-time data about spending and usage has the potential to improve people's ability to plan their finances.

Finally, there is the opportunity for giving people ways of proving facts about themselves without revealing large amounts of information. This is again particularly interesting in the context of shared households, where the person with their name on the bill is the only person able to use the value of that. Giving people the potential to prove the reality of their living situation should not be overlooked as a significant potential outcome of open APIs..

If standards developed in the UK could also be adopted internationally, there exists the opportunity to create international services - for example allowing companies operating in multiple jurisdictions the ability to manage their billing tariffs for their mobile devices. This may become increasingly important in the context of Brexit.

Further, if complementary APIs can be developed and adopted by other actors in other sectors - for example, water, energy and housing - then whole new classes of products become possible along the lines of the [BillsBox](/scenario-2-managing-utility-bills-in-a-shared-household) prototype presented in this report.

##Permissions and design

One of the most surprising things we found out, many people feel privacy policy has equal importance as price and signal strength when choosing a phone company.

Several of the people we spoke to, were nervous about how data about them, could be potentially accessed so quickly.

While many people didn't want to all data about made accessible, they were open to less sensitive information like data usage and tariff, being used to help them find better deal.

* How do we encourage new services that empower people while respecting their rights?

* We uncovered the needs? 

* Do more research? Esp on the novel things like permission in public space and groups

* Sensitive data, so good design patterns for data sharing are important

* This is doubly important because of GDPR

* What about citizen juries (esp bulk)


##Supporting data infrastructure

To enable these types of products and services, it will not be enough to provide APIs onto the core [closed data](https://theodi.org/data-spectrum) like billing or usage. There are a number of [supporting datasets](supporting-datasets-to-be-made-open) that will need to be made open under appropriate licenses.

These broadly fall into two categories.

The first is data about the infrastructure. These include things like locations of cell towers, networks speeds, lists of operators, hotspot locations and capabilities, and payment plans.

It's not just about the core closed data, also supporting datasets like locations of cell towers, tariffs and signal strength.

There second category is data about people&rsquo;s rights. Things like &lsquo;terms and conditions&rsquo;.

We have [written elsewhere](https://projectsbyif.com/blog/ethics-markets-and-registers) about the need for structured, auditable data about how organisations implement access to digital rights to enable individuals and markets to make better decisions.

To enable people and organsiations to make decisions based on privacy and their digital rights, this information will also have to be open and machine readable. So, any consideration of supporting open datasets should also examine how data about terms and conditions, and privacy policies are published.


##Public trust and oversight

The majority of people weren't aware of the data telecoms providers hold about them. Particularly location data, which most people felt very sensitive about sharing. Most felt less sensitive other data about them, like data usage and what phone tariff they were on.

New services enabled by open APIs have also present the opportunity to educate the public about what data is held about them, and improve the debate around digital ethics.

They can do this by explaining the sources of data at point-of-use, so people become more familiar about the type of data that is held about them by different types of organisation.

<!-- Automated switching is going to require things that help people trust it. Might not be gov. -->

They also open the possibility of people auditing who has accessed data about them, providing a safeguard against against misuse and fraud.

Similar the the role they play in the built environment through the planning and licensing systems, we also feel there are new roles for central and local government to play in providing new mechanisms for notifying the public about data collection and usage.

As shown in the &lsquo;[improving a city&rsquo;s air quality](/scenario-3-improving-a-citys-air-quality-using-bulk-location-data-from-mobile-phones)&rsquo; prototype, new standards for requesting data collection and new obligations to notify the public could help improve public trust in use of data for public good. From our interviews, we are confident that when given a good explanation about how and why data will be used, people are in a much better position to be able to support it.

##How to get there

As with other sectors, the direction of travel is towards better, fine-grained and real-time access to data. We see no reason to think that telecoms is significantly different from other sectors in this respect.

The main questions are therefore how this is done in a way that 1) enhances people's digital rights 2) takes advantage of the opportunity sooner rather than later.

In approaching this, it is important to understand the constraints and motivations of both existing telecoms providers and other technology organisations, especially smartphone manufacturers.

Some telecoms providers will have an interest in maintain the status quo. Worried about loosing out on features of the current switching system like the ability to call customers and offer upgrades, they may resit the adoption of standards for as long as possible, or take the path of least resistance towards compliance rather than active engagement.

Smartphone manufacturers will have an interest in centralising both switching, data mismanagement and permissions on to their platforms, which may result in more monopolies of power, not less.

As represented by the AutoSwitch sim-card prototype presented in this report, where control of switching lies is a fundamental question for policy makers to consider.

Finally, the needs of the organisaitons who will build services such as those outlines here also need to be considered. Making it easy for technology start-ups to build trusted services will require well documented APIs and design patterns, as well as guidance on security.


In order to move towards the world described in this report, we suggest the following:

* Low-hanging fruit of supporting datasets

* New research into data patterns for novel things

* Start with the what already exists (APIs). e.g. apps

* Companies may take the path of least resistance

* It will probably require legislation

* Legislate in a way that allows incremental testing and tuning of standards and design, not for big-bang compliance

* New org to set the standard? Legislation says meet the standard, not the rules

* General responsibility to be open and enable innovation

* Identify the companies who might provide the services and understand their needs

* Design rules around transparent algos and explanations

* Think about the role of regulators/independent boards in mediating switching
