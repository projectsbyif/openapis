## Opt-out of bulk data collection


## Get anonymised bulk data

For example location records, call detail records, internet connection records


## Create an account

[Bills Box](#) and [AutoSwap](#) both require APIs for creating new accounts with a provider.

Before companies take on new customers they typically check their identity and credit rating.

- Would it be possible to provide a 'pre-identity-checked' customer, to simplify the onboarding for the company?
- How to include people who are hard to identify digitally?

## Close an account

To create a world where people can easily move between providers will also require API access to closing an account.

As well as being convenient, this is an opportunity to improve people's data protection. Companies are already obliged to delete data when it's no longer needed, and storing personal information is becoming increasingly risky for companies.

An API for closing an account should:

- confirm what data has been deleted
- list any data that must be retained, and the legislation requiring it
- provide dates after which any retained data will be deleted

## Create, update and delete account holders

As well as creating and closing accounts, companies should provide API access to adding and removing people to bills.

We heard from our research that adding people to bills is time consuming and awkward, but not doing so can [lead to difficulties](#).

There are some considerations for implementing this API:

- How to manage the process of companies deciding whether to accept a new account holder?
- Who gets to authorize removing an account holder? The person leaving, the group, or something else?
