Telecommunication providers generate a huge amount of data from running their services. Through operating cell towers, mobile phone companies know the approximate location of all their subscribers at all times. Laws such as the Investigatory Powers Act require ISPs to retain Internet Connection Records for their users' network usage.

What if the data locked inside telcos could be used for public good?


## Saxford City Council wants to use bulk location data

Saxford City Council is taking measures to tackle air quality in the city centre. Along with its own high quality monitoring stations, citizens of Saxford have contributed their own air quality measurements as open data.  This has created a rich, street-level view of air pollution in Saxford.

In order to plan a potential road closure, the Council wants a better understanding of footfall in different parts of the city. This will help prioritise the streets in which the highest number of people are affected by poor air quality. The council also wants to better understand what routes drivers take in and out of the city to minimise the impact of road closures.

The Council is confident that cellular location and WiFi hotspot data would help them understand both footfall and vehicle behaviour. They have applied to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Data Protection Office</span> for permission to request bulk data from two telecommunications companies: Morlyn Mobile and Cabler Telecom.
