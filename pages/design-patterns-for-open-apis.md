Throughout research we say the need for several [design pattern](https://vimeo.com/231723090) for sharing telecoms data. Patterns for solving different problems from authentication to giving consent to controlling access. 

- Combining open data, shared data and private data
- Selecting what to share from one party to another
- Authorising using a letter
- Authorising using another factor
- Consent by SIM card
- Automated switching
- Aggregating account information for multiple utilities
- Permission to share bills / join shared bills
- Collecting unanimous consent
- Handing over accounts to new tenants
- Public space notices (lamppost / variable message sign / advertising screen)
- Human-understandable data collection request
- Machine-readable data collection request
- Plenty of time to opt-out
- Data collection minimisation
- Opting out by text
- Opting out by WiFi proximity 

## Combining open data, shared data and private data

Making more informed decisions by combining...

## Selecting what to share from one party to another

Deciding what types of data one service is allowed request from another using an Open API. This empowers people to control what data about them a services acesses. 

## Authorising using a letter

Letters, like utility bills, with printed codes to share data between utility companies and other services. Using a letter depends on being able to get post from a address. Codes can be used one, as a way to control data access.

## Authorising using another factor

Text messages are used as extra authentication when data is requested from Open APIs. This limits access to having a device controlled by a particular person. 

## Consent by SIM card

Putting a virtual SIM card into a phone, gives it the ability to freely switch between networks. Putting this small microchip into a device is a moment of consent. Opening up the ability. 

like a energy meter does in a house.

## Automated switching

Giving a computer permission to automatically find and switch service providers. A person begins by setting preferences with which to find recommendations. Over time as trust increases, more automony can be given to switch automatically without explicit permission each time. 


## Notification of automated action in the near future

Saying automated decision, like switch phone network, is soon to happen, gives a person the time to review or change it.  

## Account history across different providers

Seeing history of data usage, access and spending for one person switching between many networks. 

## Aggregating account information for multiple utilities

Multiple utilities visible and manageable from one service.  

## Permission to share bills / join shared bills

Codes generated to share the rights and responsibilities for a bill and other group data. 


## Collecting unanimous consent

Recording group decisions for data about more than one person. For example, people living in a shared home. 


## Handing over accounts to new tenants

Allowing people to take over rights and responsibility for some data. 


## Public space notices (lamppost / variable message sign / advertising screen)

Communicating that certain data about you is collected when entering a space. Includes the reason for data collection, what data is collected and how to opt-out. 

## Human-understandable data collection request

Explaining potential data collection in plain, accessible language. 

## Machine-readable data collection request

Formatting a data request in format a computer can easily access and analyse.  

## Plenty of time to opt-out

Before data collection happens, people are given ample time to find out more and decide whether to opt-out or not. 

## Data collection minimisation

Constrain data collection to certain times, location accuracy and other restrictions, to minimise personally identifiable information. 

## Opting out by text

Text messages to inform people of data collection and replying to opt-out. Text messages can be sent to people in specific locations using SMS geofencing.

## Opting out by WiFi proximity 

Holding a phone close to a WiFi hotspot to stop it collecting data about you. The hotspot detects the device is close, as the time it recieves data back from it recognisably shortens.
