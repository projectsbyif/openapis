Throughout research we say the need for several [design pattern](https://vimeo.com/231723090) for sharing telecoms data. Patterns for solving different problems from authentication to giving consent to controlling access. 

## Combining open data, shared data and private data

Making more informed decisions by combining...

## Selecting what to share from one party to another

Deciding what types of data one service is allowed request from another using an Open API. This empowers people to control what data about them a services acesses.

## Authorising data access with a letter

Letters, like utility bills, with printed codes to share data between utility companies and other services. Using a letter depends on being able to get post from a address. Codes can be used one, as a way to control data access.

## Authorising through another factor

Text messages are used as extra authentication when data is requested from Open APIs. This limits access to having a device controlled by a particular person.

## Virtual SIM card - consent by SIM card - delegating switching control

Putting a virtual SIM card into a phone, gives it the ability to freely switch between networks. Putting this small microchip into a device is a moment of consent. Opening up the ability. 

like a energy meter does in a house.

## Automated switching (a la the bank account switching)

Giving a computer permission to automatically find and switch service providers. A person begins by setting preferences with which to find recommendations. Over time as trust increases, more automony can be given to switch automatically without explicit permission each time.

## Notification of automated action in the near future

Saying automated decision, like switch phone network, is soon to happen, gives a person the time to review or change it.

## Account history across different providers

Seeing history of data usage, access and spending for one person switching between many networks.

## Aggregating account information for multiple utilities

Multiple utilities visible and manageable from one service.

## Permission to share bills / join shared bills

Codes generated to share the rights and responsibilities for a bill and other group data.

## Collecting unanimous consent

Recording group decisions for data about more than one person. For example, people living in a shared home. 

![The left screen shows the names of the housemates and the right screen shows a confirmation of moving out](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projectsbyif.com/longform/openapis.projectsbyif.com/bills-box-v3-6.png)

## Handing over accounts to new tenants

Allowing people to take over rights and responsibility for some data.
