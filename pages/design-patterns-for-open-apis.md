In research we saw need for several [design pattern](https://vimeo.com/231723090) for sharing telecoms data. Patterns for solving different problems from authentication to giving consent to controlling access and transparency. 

- Select what data a service can request
- Authorising using a letter
- Authorising using another factor
- Combining open, shared and private data
- Consent by SIM card
- Automated switching
- Future switch notice
- Account history across providers
- Displaying multiple utilities
- Share, join a bill
- Collecting group consent
- Handing over accounts to new people
- Public space notices
- Human-understandable data request
- Machine-readable data request
- Data collection minimisation
- Plenty of time to opt-out
- Opting out by text
- Opting out by WiFi proximity 

## Select what data a service can request

Deciding what types of data one service is allowed request from another using an Open API. This empowers people to control what data about them a services acesses. 

## Authorising using a letter

Letters, like utility bills, with printed codes to share data between utility companies and other services. Using a letter depends on being able to get post from a address. Codes can be used one, as a way to control data access.

## Authorising using another factor

Text messages are used as extra authentication when data is requested from Open APIs. This limits access to having a device controlled by a particular person. 

## Combining open, shared and private data

Making more informed decisions by combining data about networks and people

## Consent by SIM card

Putting a virtual SIM card into a phone, gives it the ability to freely switch between networks. Putting this small microchip into a device is a moment of consent. Opening up the ability. 

like a energy meter does in a house.

## Automated switching

Giving a computer permission to automatically find and switch service providers. A person begins by setting preferences with which to find recommendations. Over time as trust increases, more automony can be given to switch automatically without explicit permission each time. 

## Future switch notice

Saying automated decision, like switch phone network, is soon to happen, gives a person the time to review or change it.  

## Account history across providers

Seeing history of data usage, access and spending for one person switching between many networks. 

## Displaying multiple utilities

Multiple utilities visible and manageable from one service.  

## Share, join a bill

Codes generated to share the rights and responsibilities for a bill and other shared data. 


## Collecting group consent

Recording group decisions for data about more than one person. For example, people living in a shared home. 


## Handing over accounts to new people

Allowing people to take over rights and responsibility for some data. 


## Public space notices

Communicating that certain data about you is collected when entering a space. Includes the reason for data collection, what data is collected and how to opt-out. 

## Human-understandable data request

Explaining potential data collection in plain, accessible language. 

## Machine-readable data collection request

Formatting a data request in format a computer can easily access and analyse.  

## Data collection minimisation

Constrain data collection to certain times, location accuracy and other restrictions, to minimise personally identifiable information. 

## Plenty of time to opt-out

Before data collection happens, people are given ample time to find out more and decide whether to opt-out or not. 

## Opting out by text

Text messages to inform people of data collection and replying to opt-out. Text messages can be sent to people in specific locations using SMS geofencing.

## Opting out by WiFi proximity 

Holding a phone close to a WiFi hotspot to stop it collecting data about you. The hotspot detects the device is close, as the time it recieves data back from it recognisably shortens.
