# Supporting datasets to be made open

While developing [AutoSwap](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator) and [Bills Box](/scenario-2-managing-utility-bills-in-a-shared-household) we learned about areas where new open data infrastructure would be required to make them a reality.

Much of this data exists already but isn't yet accessible for public consumption.

## Register of service providers

[AutoSwap](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator) demonstrated combining personal location history with information about signal strength.

Similarly, [Bills Box](/scenario-2-managing-utility-bills-in-a-shared-household) imagined a world where bills from different utility providers could all be combined into one place.

Both scenarios would benefit from a canonical register of telecoms and other utilities providers so that data can be kept and updated in a single place.

## Register of cell tower locations

[AutoSwap](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator) demonstrated combining personal location history with information about signal strength.

To be able to measure and model signal strength requires good quality information about the location, technology and owner of cell towers.

## Product and service information

To build a service like [AutoSwap](/scenario-1-choosing-the-best-mobile-network-operator) would require a lot of information about the different product offerings.

If every service was available as a standardised data format, it would make it far simpler and cheaper for comparison services to search among a larger pool of services, including many smaller offerings. This is good for competition.

Without such a dataset, there's a high barrier to entry for comparison services and the cost of maintaining their own database means they're likely to exclude smaller, less popular companies.

We encountered a number of different types of product data that could be included in open datasets:

* Product features like bundled services, accompanying TV packages, access to streaming services and so on.
* Supported payment methods like direct debit, paypoint, credit card, paypal and bitcoin
* Credit and identity check requirements
* Tariffs
* Terms and Conditions
* Privacy Policies

## Technical information by postcode

To empower consumers to be able to make informed decisions about the companies they choose, they need access to more information. Simplistic claims like 'up to 50 megabytes' don't mean much, and can be tested against existing, high granularity data.

* Broadband technology availability, for example fibre, cable or ADSL
* Theoretical broadband speeds by postcode
* Realtime and historical line faults
* Actual (measured) network performance for different providers
* Actual (measured) signal strength for different networks

Crowdsourcing efforts such as [OpenSignal](https://opensignal.com/networks) demonstrate there is a need for this sort of data.
