Starting the work, we had a number of questions we wanted to understand:

There were a number of questions we wanted to understand:

- What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

- Can we demonstrate new services that people are actually interested in?

- What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

- What are people’s attitudes to privacy in relation to the data held about them?

- What touchpoints do people interact with the data held about them?

To answer these questions, we tested prototypes over two rounds of research. Showing the work and getting reactions from diverse range of people from the UK, France and further a field. With each person having different attitudes to privacy and confidence in using technology.

Here's are the main findings from that research:

## Privacy attitudes

The majority of people weren't aware of the data telecoms providers hold about them. Particularly location data, which most people felt very sensitive about sharing. Most felt less sensitive other data about them, like data usage and what phone tariff they were on.

One of the most surprising things we found out, many people feel privacy policy has equal importance as price and signal strength when choosing a phone company. 

Several of the people we spoke to, were nervous about how data about them, could be potentially accessed so quickly. 

While many people didn't want to all data about made accessible, they were open to less sensitive information like data usage and tariff, being used to help them find better deal.

## Consent

The majoritiy of people we test with, want options to not share date about them.
With several saying transparency about data access is not enough. They always want data sharing to be a choice. With many describing how consent to share should be a data opt-in choice. 

There was a lot of enthusiasm for group consent for joint decisions and shared data, that those in shared households. 

## Transparency

Many people asks for more knowlegde about what data about them telecoms companies held. Responding well to being shown what data is held and what it says about them, in a  understandable and accessible way. 

## Concept: all the bills in one place

The prospect of being able to see and manage all your bills in one place, was well recieved by nearly everyone we spoke too. Some people saying their would fell in more control, by seeing how much they need to pay and how much they were consuming. 

A couple of participants said they would be nervous about so much utilities data about them being available from their phone or single service like Bills Box. 

## Concept: Shared billing

Most people talk about the burden of shared bills. How currently the struggle to know who's paid what or to fix anything, unless their the 'named' person with the utility company. 

The potential to share rights and responsibilities for bills and other shared data, nearly everyone found to be a empowering prospect. There was even excited about it being easy to be recognised as a group by utilties. Avoiding workarounds and services having the recognising the more complicated

Some people currenyly work arounds like Facebook Messenger to manage bills in shared houses
Most people were enthusiast about better ways to share rights and responsibility for bills and other share data

<blockquote>“We use Facebook Messenger to manage our bills and it’s a disaster”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ah, I see, they’re all having to agree. What happens to them if they haven’t agreed? Who’s responsible for the new bills?</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s good, it works, for a houseshare, for sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Can it tell who’s been using the gigabytes, who should be paying more of it?</blockquote>

## Concept: Moving house

Most people spend a lot of effort setting and update bills when moving
Most people would like to accurately add and change who is responsible for bills in a house
Most people want to be able to leave bills and setup bills quickly when moving house

<blockquote>I think it saves you a lot of bother setting it all up again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘Move bills to new house’ - yes - I mean, that’s a brilliant job</blockquote>
<blockquote>It just makes life easier. Anything that saves time and makes life easier is a good thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If george went, you could have paul moving in the next day and taking on the bills, that would be great,</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is good, they should really have something like this. I wonder if they do.</blockquote>

## Concept: Location history signal strength

Some people found it useful to use location history to find a phone company with better signal strength for them
Some people travelling less often, found using location history less useful and more invasive

<blockquote>“I go that route a lot, it’s valuable to have good service”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“... would have better signal for my usual commute. I see my signal strength was a problem before”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While I’m travelling it’s taking my data and understanding my profile. When you travel a lot that’s very interesting”</blockquote>

## Concept: Automatic swapping

Some people wouldn't trust swapping to happen automatically
Some people would want to know the reasons they phone company was swapped automatically
Some people would want to know what money was spent and saved as a result of swapping

<blockquote>You have to be very trusting to do something like that, you’ve got no information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You’d never know how much you’re going to pay, if that’s what it’s doing.</blockquote>

## Using data to improve air quality

Some people are happy to have data about them used, when it helps make positive changes for them and their community
Most people want clear reasons what, when and why data is shared for research


## Website filtering

<blockquote>“Censorship - that’s interesting. In the EU it seems OK at the moment, I’ve heard about USA net neutrality”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Censorship? That’s not an issue here? Is there censorship?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>I didn’t know some websites are blocked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s good it’ll give you a monthly figure which sometimes you’re not sure about.</blockquote>


## Public notices

Most people want clear reasons what, when and why data is shared for research
Most people want the ability find out more about when data is collected
Most people want to know what data gets collected
Most people want a good reason the data is getting collected
Most people want time and warning before data gets collected
Most people don't understand what ‘anonymised’ means
Some people didn't understand how they could be texted by the council, without having their details


<blockquote>I can click on the link. I’ve got an option to read every single part. What’s being collected, you can opt out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It looks like it’s thorough, it looks like it’s telling me all the questions I might possibly ask.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I don’t even know what ‘anonymised’ means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would I have to have an app in order to be part of this? If I did then why would I have to text stop?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How can city council get your details? They’d have to have your details in order to send you that message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’d want to see what’s being collected.</blockquote>


## Opt-out mechanisms



<blockquote>I think if I saw that [the display sign] I wouldn’t bother texting stop. It’s different when it comes to your phone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’d feel silly. Everyone walking by. It’s completely different when it’s in your hand</blockquote>

<blockquote>I personally wouldn’t do anything that I see at a bus stop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you’ve got to text stop, is it one of these things where if you text back, is it gonna cost £9000 because it’s one of those scams? </blockquote>
<blockquote>The scary thing is, if you don’t see these signs, then you’re in it. If you don’t know you can stop, you haven’t given consent.</blockquote>
