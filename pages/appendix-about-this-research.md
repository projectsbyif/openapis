We carried out two rounds of interviews where we presented various prototypes to people and listened to their reactions.

The first round consisted of short interviews with, with five students from the Royal College of Arts.

For the secound round we professionally recruited five individuals with varied backgrounds and digital skills. We interviewed participants from France, Germany, Austria, China, Israel and the the UK.

The prototypes were iterated based on feedback from the research sessions, the final versions being the ones presented in this report.

## Research questions

Together, the research and prototyping aimed to answer a number of questions. Specifically:

- What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

- Can we demonstrate new services that people are actually interested in?

- What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

- What are people&rsquo;s attitudes to privacy in relation to the data held about them?

- What touchpoints do people interact with the data held about them?
