Starting the work, we had a number of questions we wanted to understand:

There were a number of questions we wanted to understand:

- What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

- Can we demonstrate new services that people are actually interested in?

- What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

- What are people’s attitudes to privacy in relation to the data held about them?

- What touchpoints do people interact with the data held about them?

To answer these questions, we tested prototypes over two rounds of research. Showing the work and getting reactions from diverse range of people from the UK, France and further a field. With each person having different attitudes to privacy and confidence in using technology.

Here's are the main findings from that research:

## Privacy attitudes

Some people are suprised by what data telecomns companies hold abou them
Some people are aware phones 
Some people don't want to all data about to be accessible
Some people don't want location data recorded or made available
Some people are more will for services to access data usage and tariffs
Some people are nervous how data about can be potentially accessed so easily 
Some people feel privacy policy has equal important as price and network strength when choosing a phone company
Some people believe UK has lesser privacy laws and protections
People generally want more co


<blockquote>“I’m aware that I don’t have much privacy … the UK has lax privacy laws”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometimes you’re like, how do they know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote>My network provider knows my address. Yeah, OK. Yeah that’s fine, that’s what I do every day anyway.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“What’s inside internet history? This is quite concerning”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I know [my phone company] still have access to my history, but do they keep it? For how long?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I’m in favour of deleting history”</blockquote>
<blockquote>The data usage and tariff is fine, but billing and recent locations is … private, almost.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For me it would be more concerning how they’d be able to find all this information about me.</blockquote>
<blockquote>That’s really crazy isn’t it. That’s telling you where you’ve been. Anybody could be looking at that. Is that really a feature on our phones?</blockquote>
<blockquote>Some people don’t care about their location settings, I do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even my account, I have to enter a password and it’s quite protected, how does this get all my personal information?</blockquote>
<blockquote>The whole locations thing’s weird, but i suppose that’s what phones are these days, everyone knows where everyone is.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s a difficult one because you’re trapped, everywhere. People feel like they’re always being monitored wherever they are, by their phone.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’d probably go signal strength and either price or privacy policy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I definitely would be a bit more aware of the information out there, knowing this can all be accessed by the touch of a button</blockquote>
<blockquote>Wherever you are you can be tracked by your phone. The accessibility of that is a bit concerning to me. </blockquote>

## Consent

Some people want options to not share date about them
Some people felt transparency about data access is not enough. They always want a choice. 
Some people felt that sharing data about them should always be a choice to opt in
Some people want group consent for for data about both them and others

<blockquote>“Good if my housemate has to ask me to access my data”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Good to ask because it’s my data”</blockquote>
<blockquote>The whole cookies thing, it’s ridiculous, I want to say ‘don’t track’, not ‘I know you’re doing it’.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Obviously if you said I’m happy for you to do that, great. If it’s a thing you have no choice over, that’s a problem</blockquote>
<blockquote>But I always think things should be opt in rather than opt out. If you don’t see these signs, you’re being monitored, recorded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The reality is, if this information is accessible anyway, I’d rather be asked</blockquote>

## Transparency

Some people want more knowledge about what data about them telecoms companies hold


<blockquote>I’d like to know what’s being collected…</blockquote>
<blockquote>If people had more knowledge about what was out there, maybe they’d be easier about accepting or declining access to that information.</blockquote>

## Concept: all the bills in one place

Some people said they could manage their bills more easily, were they accessible from one device
Some people were worried about all their utility information being accessible from one device

<blockquote>I can see why it’d be a good idea, having all your things in one place, accessible.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is a sure fire way to keep on top of the every day rubbish that hits me every 1st of the month.</blockquote>
<blockquote>My only concern, the amount of information that’s going to be contained on a phone.</blockquote>

## Concept: Shared billing

Some people currenyly work arounds like Facebook Messenger to manage bills in shared houses
Most people were enthusiast about better ways to share rights and responsibility for bills and other share data

<blockquote>“We use Facebook Messenger to manage our bills and it’s a disaster”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ah, I see, they’re all having to agree. What happens to them if they haven’t agreed? Who’s responsible for the new bills?</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s good, it works, for a houseshare, for sure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Can it tell who’s been using the gigabytes, who should be paying more of it?</blockquote>

## Concept: Moving house

Most people spend a lot of effort setting and update bills when moving
Most people would like to accurately add and change who is responsible for bills in a house
Most people want to be able to leave bills and setup bills quickly when moving house

<blockquote>I think it saves you a lot of bother setting it all up again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>‘Move bills to new house’ - yes - I mean, that’s a brilliant job</blockquote>
<blockquote>It just makes life easier. Anything that saves time and makes life easier is a good thing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If george went, you could have paul moving in the next day and taking on the bills, that would be great,</blockquote>
<blockquote>This is good, they should really have something like this. I wonder if they do.</blockquote>

## Concept: Location history signal strength

Some people found it useful to use location history to find a phone company with better signal strength for them
Some people travelling less often, found using location history less useful and more invasive

<blockquote>“I go that route a lot, it’s valuable to have good service”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“... would have better signal for my usual commute. I see my signal strength was a problem before”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While I’m travelling it’s taking my data and understanding my profile. When you travel a lot that’s very interesting”</blockquote>

## Concept: Automatic swapping

Some people wouldn't trust swapping to happen automatically
Some people would want to know the reasons they phone company was swapped automatically
Some people would want to know what money was spent and saved as a result of swapping

<blockquote>You have to be very trusting to do something like that, you’ve got no information.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You’d never know how much you’re going to pay, if that’s what it’s doing.</blockquote>

## Using data to improve air quality

Some people are happy to have data about them used, when it helps make positive changes for them and their community
Most people want clear reasons what, when and why data is shared for research


## Website filtering

<blockquote>“Censorship - that’s interesting. In the EU it seems OK at the moment, I’ve heard about USA net neutrality”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Censorship? That’s not an issue here? Is there censorship?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>I didn’t know some websites are blocked.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It’s good it’ll give you a monthly figure which sometimes you’re not sure about.</blockquote>


## Public notices

Most people want clear reasons what, when and why data is shared for research
Most people want the ability find out more about when data is collected
Most people want to know what data gets collected
Most people want a good reason the data is getting collected
Most people want time and warning before data gets collected
Most people don't understand what ‘anonymised’ means
Some people didn't understand how they could be texted by the council, without having their details


<blockquote>I can click on the link. I’ve got an option to read every single part. What’s being collected, you can opt out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It looks like it’s thorough, it looks like it’s telling me all the questions I might possibly ask.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I don’t even know what ‘anonymised’ means.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Would I have to have an app in order to be part of this? If I did then why would I have to text stop?</blockquote>
<blockquote>How can city council get your details? They’d have to have your details in order to send you that message.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I’d want to see what’s being collected.</blockquote>


## Opt-out mechanisms



<blockquote>I think if I saw that [the display sign] I wouldn’t bother texting stop. It’s different when it comes to your phone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I’d feel silly. Everyone walking by. It’s completely different when it’s in your hand</blockquote>

<blockquote>I personally wouldn’t do anything that I see at a bus stop.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you’ve got to text stop, is it one of these things where if you text back, is it gonna cost £9000 because it’s one of those scams? </blockquote>
<blockquote>The scary thing is, if you don’t see these signs, then you’re in it. If you don’t know you can stop, you haven’t given consent.</blockquote>
