We carried out two rounds of interviews where we presented the prototypes to people and listened to their reactions.

The first round of interviews were quick and rough, with five students from the Royal College of Arts.

For the secound round we professionally recruited five individuals with varied backgrounds and digital skills. We interviewed participants from France, Germany, Austria, China Israel and the the UK.

## Research questions

There were a number of questions we wanted to understand:

- What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

- Can we demonstrate new fictional services that people are actually interested in?

- What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

- What are peopleâ€™s attitudes to privacy in relation to the data held about them?

- What touchpoints do people interact with the data held about them?
