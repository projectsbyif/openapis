Starting the work, we had a number of questions we wanted to understand:

- What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

- Can we demonstrate new services that people are actually interested in?

- What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

- What are people’s attitudes to privacy in relation to the data held about them?

- What needs do people have for the controlling telecoms data about them?

To answer these questions, we tested prototypes with ten people over two rounds of research. Showing the work and getting reactions from diverse groups from the UK, France and further a field. With each person having different attitudes to privacy and confidence in using technology.

Here's are the main findings from that research:

## Privacy attitudes

The majority of people weren't aware of the data telecoms providers hold about them. Particularly location data, which most people felt very sensitive about sharing. Most felt less sensitive other data about them, like data usage and what phone tariff they were on.

One of the most surprising things we found out, many people feel privacy policy has equal importance as price and signal strength when choosing a phone company. 

Several of the people we spoke to, were nervous about how data about them, could be potentially accessed so quickly. 

While many people didn't want to all data about made accessible, they were open to less sensitive information like data usage and tariff, being used to help them find better deal.

## Consent

The majority of people we tested with, wanted options to not share data about them.
With several saying transparency about data access is not enough. They always want data sharing to be a choice. With many describing how consent to share should be a data opt-in choice. 

There was a lot of enthusiasm for group consent for joint decisions and shared data, like those in shared households. 

## Transparency

Many people asks for more knowledge about what data about them telecoms companies held. Responding well to being shown what data is held and what it says about them, in a  understandable and accessible way. 

## Concept: all the bills in one place

The prospect of being able to see and manage all your bills in one place, was well received by nearly everyone we spoke too. Some people saying they would feel more in control, by seeing how much they need to pay and how much they were consuming. 

A couple of participants said they would be nervous about so much utilities data about them being available from their phone or single service like Bills Box. 

## Concept: Shared billing

Most people talk about the burden of shared bills. How currently the struggle to know who's paid what or to fix anything, unless their the 'named' person with the utility company. 

The potential to share rights and responsibilities for bills and other shared data, nearly everyone found to be a empowering prospect. There was even excitement about it being easy to be recognised as a group by utility companies, acknowledging the more real and complicated living situations most people have.

## Concept: Moving house

Nearly each person we spoke was very positive about the idea they could move and transfer bills when moving house. How this would save all the time involved now, when cancelling and setting up billings from one property to the next. 

The concept was especially promising to the half dozen people we spoke to who rent; who move house more often and have some housemates leave, while others stay on. 

## Concept: Location history signal strength

Half the people when tested with, welcomed the idea of using their location history to choose a phone company with better signal strength for them. The idea was more popular with people who commute and travel a lot. 

The people who travel less often, found using location history for better signal strength less useful. And having concerns what this meant for their privacy. 

## Concept: Automatic swapping

For many people, the concept of just automatically swapping phone company is something they would struggle to trust. They would need more control over the decision to swap a contract. 

Many people wanted more information about the reason a swap happened and what benefits came from it, like savings or better phone strength. 

Also many people we spoke with used the language like 'contracts' and 'signing' when talking about moving networks. Suggesting a current mental model that you can only stay with one phone company for months and years, not weeks and days hinted at in the prototype we showed. 

## Website filtering

The perception from people we tested with, was there was little or no censorship by internet provider. There was limited awareness of internet providers blocking some websites. A couple of people we spoke knew about net neutrality and that this is something we have in Europe. 

## Using data to improve air quality

Half the people we spoke to, were happy to have data about them used, when it helps make positive changes for their community. They showed a need to understand what data is being collected, when it will happen and a good reason as to why. 

## Public notices

As mentioned before, many people wanted clear reasons what, when and why data is shared for research. A couple of like the ability find out more about when data is collected, so they could make a informed decision to have data about them included or not. 

However there was limited understanding by most people for how their location could be collected and what ‘anonymised’ means. So it is questionable if people individually have the time and capacity to make decisions about bulk data collection for research. There the need for alternative consent models for these scenarios. 

## Opt-out mechanisms

Some of the people said they would be hesitant about opting-out. Because they either would not trust texting a random number or feel self-conscious about doing it in a way others could see. 

The same people said they be worried, should they not see the signs, data about them would get collected anyway.
