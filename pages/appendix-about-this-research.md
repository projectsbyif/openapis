We begin the worked asking a question, **what types of data do telecom companies hold?**

To try answer this, we interviewed five people working in the telecom sectors in the UK and France. Including broadband, mobile and fixed line. 

From these conversations, we had a working idea of the different types of telecoms data that exists and therefore has potential to be made available by open APIs. 

Next we wanted to understand some follow up questions:

* What could people do that they cannot do now, if open telecom APIs existed?

* Can we demonstrate new services that people are actually interested in?

* What data do people understand phone & broadband providers hold about them?

* What are peopleâ€™s attitudes to privacy in relation to telecoms data held about them?

* What needs do people have for the controlling telecoms data about them?

To answer these questions, we tested prototypes with ten people over two rounds of research. Showing the work and getting reactions from diverse groups from the UK, France and further a field. With each person having different attitudes to privacy and confidence in using technology.

The prototypes were iterated based on feedback from the research sessions, the final versions being the ones presented in this report.
