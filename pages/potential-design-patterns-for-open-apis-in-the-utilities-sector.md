The prototyping for this report uncovered several potentual [design patterns](https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com) for solving different problems, from authentication to giving consent to controlling access and transparency. We believe many of these may be useful for desinging services for open APIs in the wider utilities sector.

## Select what data a service can share

Deciding what types of data one service is allowed request from another using an Open API. This empowers people to control what data about them a services acesses. 

## Authorising using a letter

Letters, like utility bills, with printed codes to share data between utility companies and other services. Using a letter depends on being able to get post from a address. Codes can be used one, as a way to control data access.

## Authorising using another factor

Text messages are used as extra authentication when data is requested from Open APIs. This limits access to having a device controlled by a particular person. 

## Combining open, shared and closed data

Making more informed decisions by combining data about networks and people

## Consent by SIM card

Putting a virtual SIM card into a phone, gives it the ability to freely switch between networks. Putting this small microchip into a device is a moment of consent. Opening up the ability. 

like a energy meter does in a house.

## Automated switching

Giving a computer permission to automatically find and switch service providers. A person begins by setting preferences with which to find recommendations. Over time as trust increases, more automony can be given to switch automatically without explicit permission each time. 

## Future switch notice

Saying automated decision, like switch phone network, is soon to happen, gives a person the time to review or change it.  

## Account history across providers

Seeing history of data usage, access and spending for one person switching between many networks. 

## Displaying multiple utilities

Multiple utilities visible and manageable from one service.  

## Share, join a bill

Codes generated to share the rights and responsibilities for a bill and other shared data. 


## Getting group consent

Recording group decisions for data about more than one person. For example, people living in a shared home. 


## Handing over accounts to new people

Allowing people to take over rights and responsibility for some data. 


## Public space notices

Communicating that certain data about you is collected when entering a space. Includes the reason for data collection, what data is collected and how to opt-out. 

## Human-understandable data request

Explaining potential data collection in plain, accessible language. 

## Machine-readable data request

Formatting a data request in format a computer can easily access and analyse.  

## Data collection minimisation

Constrain data collection to certain times, location accuracy and other restrictions, to minimise personally identifiable information. 

## Plenty of time to opt-out

Before data collection happens, people are given ample time to find out more and decide whether to opt-out or not. 

## Opting out by text

Text messages to inform people of data collection and replying to opt-out. Text messages can be sent to people in specific locations using SMS geofencing.

## Opting out by WiFi proximity 

Holding a phone close to a WiFi hotspot to stop it collecting data about you. The hotspot detects the device is close, as the time it recieves data back from it recognisably shortens.
