There's no shortage of websites that'll help you find a new mobile phone contract or broadband provider.

Today's comparison sites are typically geared towards price, showing you the cheapest deal. These sites usually get paid when a customer switches, so it's in their interest to waste no time, and ask as few questions as possible. Your profile is reduced to just a few numbers:  how many minutes, texts and gigabytes.

What if a comparison service had access to richer information about you? What if it knew about the places you struggle with signal strength? Or your preference for strong ethics and privacy protections? Or your _real_ data usage, not just a single monthly number.


## AutoSwap helps you choose the best provider for you
