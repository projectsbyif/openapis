When people live together they often take on shared responsibility for paying and managing the bills. In many households, people come and go periodically, creating a paper trail that can be awkward to decipher.

<blockquote>
"We use Facebook Messenger to manage our bills and it’s a disaster"
</blockquote>

Many companies default to a single, individual account holder.

When things go wrong, companies will only speak to the account holder, and adding people involves jumping through hoops. When people leave a house it can put the other housemates in a tricky situation.

What if it was simple to deal with companies as a group? How might decision making work? What if utilities could be 'handed over' to the next occupier, just like keys?

## Bills Box helps you share the running of the house

Bills Box helps you split the bills with others in your house while allowing everyone to see all the accounts in one place.

## Connect your utilities in one step

To get started, just point Bills Box at the standard barcode on the bottom of your utility bill.

<p class="narrator">This is similar to the tariff comparison barcodes present on gas and electricity bills. The barcode would contain some sort of authentication token.</p>


As soon as you've connected an account, Bills Box uses the Open Utility APIs to download your billing and usage information, so you'll always know how much using and what you're paying.

You can add any utility account that adheres to the Open Utility Standards. Now you can see all your household spending in one place.

## Adding a housemate is simple

Bills Box helps you put new housemates on the bills - something that used to be time consuming and difficult. That way, there's no awkward surprise when the person who pays the gas moves out, forgetting to tell the others.

<blockquote>"only one person on the bill, you can’t even call them because you’re not the authorized person"
</blockquote>

Before joining, the new housemate can see what they're signing up for. Once they go ahead, they're automatically added to all the accounts.

<blockquote>"If George went, you could have Paul moving in the next day and taking on the bills, that would be great"</blockquote>
## Moving house together

Some decisions involve the whole house, and Bills Box makes it easy for you to make decisions as a group. Take moving out, for example.

One housemate can start off the process, then once everyone agrees, Bills Box can tell your provider that you've all agreed to move out.

If you're all moving together, Bills Box can even take your accounts with you to the new address.

<blockquote>"That’s brilliant, if you could go ‘I’m moving house, go tell everyone I need to tell’"</blockquote>
## Helping out the next tenants

As well as tying up loose ends, Bills Box makes it simple for the next tenants. That helps ensure there's a clean switch, and no chasing bills months after you've moved out.

And perhaps Bills Box will make your life simpler, next time you move into a new home.
