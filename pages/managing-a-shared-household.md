When people live together they often take on shared responsibility for paying and managing the bills. In many households, people come and go periodically, creating a paper trail that can be awkward to decipher.

Many companies default to a single, individual account holder.

When things go wrong, companies will only speak to the account holder, and adding people involves jumping through hoops. When people leave a house it can put the other housemates in a tricky situation.

What if it was simple to deal with companies as a group? How might decision making work? What if utilities could be 'handed over' to the next occupier, just like keys?
