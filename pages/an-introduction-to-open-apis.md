Digital and [data](https://theodi.org/what-is-data-infrastructure) infrastructure has the potential to radically empower people.

By using digital services we all create a huge amount of data. Often, the value of that data is locked away in the company and inaccessible to the person who created it.

Upcoming new digital rights grant us more access and control over that data.

By embracing Open APIs, powerful new services can exist that empower people in ways we can&rsquo;t yet imagine.

## Open APIs are an alternative to online portals and phone calls

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a channel for interacting with an organisation as an alternative to websites, apps, letters and phone calls.  An open API will behave in a way described in an [open standard](https://theodi.org/blog/documenting-the-development-of-open-standards-for-data).  Open standards are created collaboratively, use open processes and are published under terms that allow them to be freely used for any purpose.

Any interaction with an organisation such as viewing a bill, adding a standing order or raising a support request could be implemented as an open API.

APIs are designed to be accessed by software rather than directly by humans. This allows developers to build on top of those APIs, interacting with an organisation on a person&rsquo;s behalf.

## Open APIs enable new services to exist

As an example, airlines allow people to search for flights on their website. Many also offer the same search through an API, allowing useful services like SkyScanner to search hundreds of airlines simultaneously.

APIs power many of the things we&rsquo;ve become used to like paying for things online, comparing prices, and switching bank accounts.

A transformation is underway with [the Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk) with new services giving people new access and control over data about them.

## Open APIs will help people exercise their digital rights

The upcoming [GDPR legislation](#) grants new rights, particularly better access, portability and deletion of data.

Companies will need to implement new systems to allow people to exercise these rights. To avoid a repeat of disempowering cookie-banners, these should be implemented in a consistent and people-centred way.

Specifically, they should create these systems as standardized Open APIs, rather than an ad-hoc assortment of new online portals.
