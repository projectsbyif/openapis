An Application Programming Interface (API) is a channel for interacting with an organisation as an alternative to websites, apps, letters and phone calls.

APIs are designed to be accessed by software rather than directly by humans. This allows developers to build on top of those APIs, interacting with an organisation on a person&rsquo;s behalf.

An __open__ API is one that is described in an [open standard](https://theodi.org/blog/documenting-the-development-of-open-standards-for-data).

Open standards are created collaboratively, use open processes and are published under terms that allow them to be freely used for any purpose.

As an example, airlines allow people to search for flights on their website. Many also offer the same search through an API, allowing useful services like SkyScanner to search hundreds of airlines simultaneously.

APIs power many of the things we&rsquo;ve become used to like paying for things online, comparing prices, and switching bank accounts.

By embracing Open APIs, powerful new services can exist that empower people in ways we can&rsquo;t yet imagine.

For example, banking services in the UK are currently changing as part of the [the Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk). It will allow totally new financial services to be developed using open APIs.

Alongside banking, open APIs for telecoms could form a critical part of the UK&rsquo;s [data infrastructure ](https://theodi.org/what-is-data-infrastructure) with the potential to radically empower people.
