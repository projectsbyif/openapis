There's no shortage of websites that'll help you find a new mobile phone contract or broadband provider.

Today's comparison sites are typically geared towards price, showing you the cheapest deal. These sites usually get paid when a customer switches, so it's in their interest to waste no time, and ask as few questions as possible. Your profile is reduced to just a few numbers:  how many minutes, texts and gigabytes.

What if a comparison service had access to richer information about you? What if it knew about the places you struggle with signal strength? Or your preference for strong ethics and privacy protections? Or your _real_ data usage, not just a single monthly number.

## AutoSwap helps you choose the best provider for you

AutoSwap recommends the perfect phone contract by learning and understanding your behaviour.

With your permission, it uses the new Open Utility APIs to understand the types of calls you make, your internet usage and the areas where you really need good signal.

By using your location data, AutoSwap can work out your commute and find the provider with the best signal strength for you.

For many people, it's not just about price. AutoSwap lets you prioritise what matters to you, and takes that into account when searching for providers.

Once you've chosen a new provider, we'll send you a flexible SIM card which supports all UK telecoms companies. Next time you won't need to fiddle around swapping SIM cards, and it'll be even easier to switch again.

If your usage changes or a company launches a new deal, AutoSwap will immediately recalculate its recommendation. It can even switch provider automatically for you, handling all the paperwork and payments.
