Digital infrastructure has the potential to radically empower people.

By using digital services we all generate a huge amount of data. Often, the value of that data is locked away in the company and inaccessible to the person who created it.

Upcoming new digital rights grant us more access and control over that data.

By embracing Open APIs, powerful new services can exist that empower people in ways we can't yet imagine.

## Open APIs are an alternative to online portals and phone calls

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a channel for interacting with an organisation as an alternative to websites, apps, letters and phone calls.

Any interaction with an organisation such as viewing a bill, adding a standing order or raising a support request could be implemented as an API.

APIs are designed to be accessed by software rather than directly by humans. This allows developers to build on top of those APIs, interacting with an organisation on a person's behalf.

## Open APIs enable new things to exist

As an example, airlines allow people to search for flights on their website. Many also offer the same search through an API, allowing useful services like SkyScanner to search hundreds of airlines simultaneously.

APIs power many of the things we've become used to like paying for things online, comparing prices, and switching bank accounts.

A transformation is underway with [the Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk) with new services giving people new access and control over their data.

## Open APIs will help people exercise their digital rights

The upcoming [GDPR legislation](#) grants new rights, particularly better access, portability and deletion of data.

Companies will need to implement new systems to allow people to exercise these rights. To avoid a repeat of disempowering cookie-banners, these should be implemented in a consistent and people-centred way.

Specifically, they should create these systems as standardized Open APIs, rather than an ad-hoc assortment of new online portals.

We worked with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) to investigate how Open APIs into telecommunications and utility companies could give people new powers and better control over their data.

## Open API case studies

To illustrate the possibilities of new Open APIs, we designed three useful new services that use data in new ways while respecting people's rights.

[Case: Managing a shared household](/case-managing-a-shared-household)

[Case: Improving a city's air quality](/case-improving-a-citys-air-quality)


## Potential design patterns

While developing the prototypes we encountered cases where existing design patterns are helpful, and uncovered several new design patterns.

The following patterns felt particularly interesting:

*   Combining open data, shared data and private data
*   Selecting what to share from one party to another
*   Virtual SIM cards for automated switching
*   Authorising digital access from a physical letter
*   Public space notices
*   Human-friendly data collection requests

## Potential new APIs

As we imagined new services built on top of telecoms data, we started to understand what sort of APIs would have to exist to make it possible.
