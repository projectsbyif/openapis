Digital infrastructure has the potential to radically empower people. As we're starting to see with the [The Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk), services are emerging that meet people's needs in a new way, powered by data people have more control over.

We worked with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) to investigate how APIs from telecommunications and utility companies could follow the model set by Open Banking.


## Open API prototypes

To illustrate the potential of access to telecoms data, we developed prototypes of fictional new services that would be unlocked by new Open APIs.

## Design patterns

While developing the prototypes we encountered cases where existing design patterns are helpful, and uncovered several new design patterns.

The following patterns felt particularly interesting:



*   Combining open data, shared data and private data
*   Selecting what to share from one party to another
*   Virtual SIM cards for automated switching
*   Authorising digital access from a physical letter
*   Public space notices
*   Human-friendly data collection requests

## Potential new APIs

As we imagined new services built on top of telecoms data, we started to understand what sort of APIs would have to exist to make it possible.
