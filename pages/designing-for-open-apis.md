Digital infrastructure has the potential to radically empower people.

By using digital services we all generate a huge amount of data. Often, the value of that data is locked away in the company and inaccessible to the person who created it.

Upcoming new digital rights grant us more access and control over that data.

By embracing Open APIs, powerful new services can exist that empower people in ways we can't yet imagine.

## APIs are everywhere

An Application Programming Interface (API) allows data to be sent between different types of computer systems. Are designed to be used by software rather than directly by humans. 

APIs power many of the things we've become used to, like paying for things online, comparing prices, and switching bank accounts. Allowing people to use data at scale and speed previously not possible.   

## Open APIs enable new services to exist

When made open and available to build with, APIs allow whole new services and markets to exist.

As an example, airlines allow people to search for flights on their website. Many also offer the same search through an API, allowing useful services like SkyScanner to search hundreds of airlines simultaneously.

A transformation is underway with [the Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk) with new services giving people new access and control over their data.

## Open APIs will help people exercise their digital rights

The upcoming [GDPR legislation](#) grants new rights, particularly better access, portability and deletion of data.

Companies will need to implement new systems to allow people to exercise these rights. To avoid a repeat of disempowering cookie-banners, these should be implemented in a consistent and people-centred way.

Specifically, they should create these systems as standardized Open APIs, rather than an ad-hoc assortment of new online portals.

We worked with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) to investigate how Open APIs into telecommunications and utility companies could give people new powers and better control over their data.

## Open API case studies

To illustrate the possibilities of new Open APIs, we designed three useful new services that use data in new ways while respecting people's rights.

[Case: Managing a shared household](/case-managing-a-shared-household)

[Case: Improving a city's air quality](/case-improving-a-citys-air-quality)


## Open API design patterns

By designing and testing the case studies, we saw the need for potential new [design patterns](https://vimeo.com/231723090). As well as applying existing patterns to the context of sharing telecoms data. 

The following potential patterns felt particularly interesting:

*   Combining open, shared and private data
*   Select what data a service can request
*   Consent by SIM card
*   Authorising using a letter
*   Public space notices
*   Human-understandable data request

## Potential new APIs

As we imagined new services built on top of telecoms data, we started to understand what sort of APIs would have to exist to make it possible.
