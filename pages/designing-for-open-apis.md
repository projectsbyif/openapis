Digital infrastructure has the potential to radically empower people. As we're starting to see with the [The Open Banking Standard](https://www.openbanking.org.uk), services are emerging that meet people's needs in a new way, powered by data people have more control over.

## Open APIs give users more access and control

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a channel for interacting with an organisation as an alternative to websites, apps, letters and phone calls.

APIs are designed to be accessed by software rather than directly by humans. This allows developers to build applications and services to interact with the company, acting on their users' behalf.

For example, airlines allow users to search for flights on their website. Many also offer the same search through an API, allowing useful services like SkyScanner to search hundreds of airlines simultaneously.

APIs power many of the things we've become used to like paying for things online, comparing prices, and switching bank accounts.

We worked with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) to investigate how APIs from telecommunications and utility companies could follow the model set by Open Banking.


## Open API prototypes

To illustrate the potential of access to telecoms data, we developed prototypes of fictional new services that would be unlocked by new Open APIs.

## Potential design patterns

While developing the prototypes we encountered cases where existing design patterns are helpful, and uncovered several new design patterns.

The following patterns felt particularly interesting:

*   Combining open data, shared data and private data
*   Selecting what to share from one party to another
*   Virtual SIM cards for automated switching
*   Authorising digital access from a physical letter
*   Public space notices
*   Human-friendly data collection requests

## Potential new APIs

As we imagined new services built on top of telecoms data, we started to understand what sort of APIs would have to exist to make it possible.
