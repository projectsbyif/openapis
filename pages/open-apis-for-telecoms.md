We prototyped three scenarios that could arise as a result of open APIs existing in the telecoms sector. These were informed by interviews with experts in the industry and tested using UK and international participants.

The aims were to:

1. Identify which APIs the industry and government should prioritise
2. Identify potential [design patterns](https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com) for products and services built using these APIs
3. Understand people&rsquo;s needs for privacy and control in relation to telecoms data

This report presents the final prototypes and research findings, as well as  making recommendations for how government and industry might implement telecoms-specific open APIs.
