[IF](https://projectsbyif.com) in collaboration with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) prototyped three scenarios that would be possible if open [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) existed for the telecoms sector. These were informed by expert interviews with people in the sector. The prototypes were then tested with UK and international participants during a series of user research sessions.

The aim of the prototyping and research was to:


1. Identify which APIs the industry and government should prioritise
2. Identify potential [design patterns](https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com) for products and services built using these APIs
3. Understand people&rsquo;s needs for privacy and control in relation to telecoms data

This report presents the final prototypes and research findings, and makes recommendations for how government and industry might implement open APIs for the telecoms sector.
