[IF](https://projectsbyif.com) in collaboration with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org) prototyped 3 scenarios that would be possible if open [API&rsquo;s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) existed for the telecoms sector.

These prototypes were then tested with UK and international participants during 2 user research sessions. 

The aim of the prototyping and research was to identify people&rsquo;s understanding of issues of privacy and data sharing in relation to telecoms data, which APIs the industry and government should prioritise and identify potential [design patterns](https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com) for products and services built on top of APIs containing sensitive in telecoms and the wider utilities sector.
